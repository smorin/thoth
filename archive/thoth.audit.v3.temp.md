## Inconsistency INC-V3-001: Default Mode Usage Clarity

**Issue**: Conflicting information about when default mode is actually used

**Plan Reference**: 
- Line 213: "(default) Run research (defaults to deep_research mode)"

**PRD Reference**:
- Line 206: "thoth \"QUERY\" # Deep research with output to current directory"
- Line 69: "Default mode | When no mode is specified, uses a special 'default' mode"

**Reason**: The plan's command reference still shows "defaults to deep_research mode" which conflicts with the PRD's clear statement that quick mode uses "default" mode (no system prompt).

**Resolution Options**:
1. Update plan's command reference to clarify default mode behavior
2. Add explicit note that quick mode uses "default" not "deep_research"

**Recommendation**: Option 1 - Update the command reference to be consistent with the mode system implementation.

**Final Decision**: Add explicit note that quick mode uses "default" not "deep_research" and update the PRD references and Plan References. Make sure to update al the line number and id references above.

## Inconsistency INC-V3-002: Version Number Mismatch

**Issue**: Document version numbers don't match

**Plan Reference**:
- Line 1: "Thoth v1.5 Implementation Plan"

**PRD Reference**:
- Line 1: "Product Requirements Document – Thoth v1.7"
- Line 12: "Target Release | v1.7"

**Reason**: The plan still references v1.5 while the PRD has been updated to v1.7.

**Resolution Options**:
1. Update plan header to reference v1.7
2. Keep plan at v1.5 as it represents implementation version

**Recommendation**: Option 1 - Align version numbers for consistency.

**Final Decision**: Align version numbers for consistency to v19. Make sure to update al the line number and id references above.

## Inconsistency INC-V3-003: Test ID References

**Issue**: Some test IDs in plan don't match PRD test IDs exactly

**Plan Reference**:
- Line 104: "[T-CLI-02]" for "--provider flag limits execution"
- Line 178: "[T-CLI-02]" for "-P short flag" requirement

**PRD Reference**:
- Line 131: "F-02 | Accept query as single positional argument | T-CLI-01"
- Line 178: "F-39 | Support -P as short form for --provider flag | T-CLI-02"

**Reason**: The plan uses T-CLI-02 for two different tests, creating potential confusion.

**Resolution Options**:
1. Renumber test IDs to avoid duplicates
2. Add sub-IDs like T-CLI-02a and T-CLI-02b

**Recommendation**: Option 1 - Use unique test IDs throughout.

**Final Decision**: Use unique test IDs throughout and update in Plan and PRD References above. Make sure to update al the line number and id references above.

## Inconsistency INC-V3-004: Output Default Behavior Documentation

**Issue**: Subtle difference in how default output behavior is described

**Plan Reference**:
- Line 485: "combine_reports = false # create combined report only with --combined flag"

**PRD Reference**:
- Line 485: "combine_reports = false # create combined report only with --combined flag"

**Reason**: While these match now, the plan's test section still references old behavior in comments.

**Resolution Options**:
1. Review all comments in plan for outdated references
2. Leave as is since the implementation is correct

**Recommendation**: Option 1 - Clean up any outdated comments for clarity.

**Final Decision**: Make sure to update al the line number and id references above. Leave as is since the implementation is correct

## Inconsistency INC-V3-005: Progress Display Implementation Status

**Issue**: Progress display implementation status unclear

**Plan Reference**:
- Line 215: "M7-10: Update progress display to show elapsed time, next check, and timeout"
- Line 219: "Verify progress shows elapsed time, next check, and timeout ❌ *Not implemented*"

**PRD Reference**:
- Lines 382-391: Shows detailed progress display example with elapsed time, next check, and timeout

**Reason**: The PRD shows this feature as implemented while the plan marks it as not implemented.

**Resolution Options**:
1. Update plan to reflect current implementation status
2. Clarify what parts are actually implemented vs planned

**Recommendation**: Option 2 - Add clarity about which progress features are working vs planned.

**Final Decision**: Clarify what parts are actually implemented vs planned. Make sure to update al the line number and id references above.

## Inconsistency INC-V3-006: Commands List Formatting

**Issue**: Minor formatting inconsistency in commands list

**Plan Reference**:
- Lines 212-217: Commands list without descriptions

**PRD Reference**:
- Lines 212-217: Same structure but with clearer formatting

**Reason**: Not a functional issue but formatting consistency helps readability.

**Resolution Options**:
1. Align formatting between documents
2. Keep different formatting as they serve different purposes

**Recommendation**: Option 2 - Different documents can have different formatting styles.

**Final Decision**: Different documents can have different formatting styles. Make sure to update al the line number and id references above.

## Inconsistency INC-V3-007: Missing New Commands Documentation

**Issue**: New commands mentioned in plan but not in PRD

**Plan Reference**:
- Line 491: "Implement update command (new)"
- Line 492: "Implement clean command (new)"
- Line 493: "Add config command (new)"

**PRD Reference**:
- Lines 310-311: Only shows init, status, and list commands

**Reason**: The plan includes future commands not yet documented in the PRD.

**Resolution Options**:
1. Add future commands to PRD with "planned" status
2. Keep PRD focused on current functionality only

**Recommendation**: Option 2 - PRD should document current state; plan shows future work.

**Final Decision**:  PRD should document current state; plan shows future work. Make sure to update al the line number and id references above.

## Inconsistency INC-V3-008: Quiet Mode Flag Format

**Issue**: Minor inconsistency in quiet mode flag documentation

**Plan Reference**:
- Line 770: "Quiet Mode (-q flag referenced but not implemented)"

**PRD Reference**:
- Line 298: "--quiet | | flag | Minimal output during execution"

**Reason**: Plan references "-q" short form but PRD doesn't show a short form for --quiet.

**Resolution Options**:
1. Add -q short form to PRD
2. Remove -q reference from plan

**Recommendation**: Option 2 - If no short form is implemented, remove the reference.

**Final Decision**: -q is not accurate make `-Q` and udpate plan and PRD.  Make sure to update al the line number and id references above.
