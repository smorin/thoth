# Thoth v6 PRD Analysis

## Section 1: Document Control
✓ Consistent with v0.6 target release and date

## Section 2: Executive Summary
✓ Well-structured overview
✓ Core value propositions are clear
⚠️ Mentions "single-file Python tool" but dependencies suggest it might be more complex

## Section 3: Product Overview
✓ Vision aligns with executive summary
✓ Target users are well-defined
✓ Key features match functionality described later

## Section 4: Glossary
✓ Terms are well-defined
⚠️ "Operation ID" and "Research ID" used interchangeably - could cause confusion
⚠️ Missing definition for "slug" used in F-12

## Section 5: Objectives
✓ Clear objectives that align with features
✓ All objectives are measurable

## Section 6: Out of Scope
✓ Clear boundaries for v0.6
✓ Reasonable exclusions

## Section 7: Assumptions
✓ Reasonable technical assumptions
⚠️ Python ≥ 3.11 requirement but script header shows tomli for Python < 3.11 (inconsistent)

## Section 8: Functional Requirements
✓ Comprehensive requirements list
⚠️ F-12 mentions "slug" but it's not defined in glossary
⚠️ F-21 and F-09 overlap (status checking vs resume)
✓ F-23 and F-24 are good additions

## Section 9: Non-Functional Requirements
✓ Good performance metrics
⚠️ N-01 "≤2 per minute" contradicts default poll interval of 30s (which would be 2 per minute exactly)

## Section 10: Command-Line Interface

### Issues Found:
1. **Conflicting async flags**: Both `--async/-A` and `--no-wait` are mentioned as the same thing
2. **Inconsistent invocation patterns**: 
   - `thoth -A <mode> -q "Query..."` suggests mode after -A
   - But options matrix shows -A as a flag only
3. **Missing from options matrix**: `init` and `status` commands shown in patterns but not in matrix
4. **--research-id vs --resume**: Shows as aliases but could be clearer
5. **--organization flag**: Mentioned in matrix but not used in examples

## Section 11: Interactive Modes
✓ Clear wizard flows
⚠️ `thoth init` saves to `~/.thoth/config.toml` but section 14 shows separate config files
⚠️ Inconsistency: "config.toml" vs separate files (models.toml, modes.toml, defaults.toml)

## Section 12: Exit Codes
✓ Comprehensive exit code list
✓ Consistent with error handling section

## Section 13: Technical Requirements

### Issues:
1. **Dependency conflicts**: Lists both `typer` and `click` which overlap in functionality
2. **Missing imports**: Code examples use `datetime`, `Path`, `os` but not mentioned
3. **Async implementation issues**:
   - OpenAI code uses "developer" role which isn't standard
   - Perplexity async handling shows "pass" - incomplete
   - `generate_operation_id()` function referenced but not defined

## Section 14: Configuration Files

### Issues:
1. **File organization confusion**: 
   - Section 11 mentions single `config.toml`
   - This section shows three separate files
2. **Missing fields**: 
   - API key configuration not shown
   - Provider-specific settings incomplete
3. **Path inconsistency**: `output_dir = "~/research"` might not expand properly

## Section 15: Implementation Architecture

### Issues:
1. **Missing imports**: Uses `AsyncOpenAI` but not imported
2. **Incomplete methods**: Many methods just have `pass`
3. **Type hints**: `List["ProviderStatus"]` uses string quotes unnecessarily
4. **Missing ResearchResult class**: Referenced but not defined
5. **CheckpointManager**: Uses `asdict` without importing from dataclasses

## Section 16: User Experience
✓ Good progress display mockup
✓ Clear error handling examples

## Section 17: Error-Handling Strategy
✓ Comprehensive error handling
✓ Matches exit codes from Section 12

## Section 18: Security and Privacy
✓ Good security practices
⚠️ Mentions API key validation but no implementation shown

## Section 19: Success Metrics
✓ Clear, measurable metrics
✓ Realistic targets

## Section 20: Open Issues
✓ Good identification of potential problems
✓ Reasonable mitigations

## Section 21: Future Enhancements
✓ Clear roadmap
✓ Logical progression of features

## Section 22: Appendix
✓ Helpful API response examples
⚠️ OpenAI response shows "realtime.response" object type which seems incorrect

## Major Inconsistencies Summary:

1. **Configuration file structure**: Single config.toml vs multiple files
2. **Command-line interface**: Async flag naming and usage
3. **Python version**: Claims ≥3.11 but includes compatibility for <3.11
4. **Polling rate**: Default 30s conflicts with ≤2 per minute requirement
5. **Implementation gaps**: Many undefined functions and incomplete code
6. **Role naming**: "developer" role in OpenAI API (should be "system")
7. **Missing definitions**: slug, ResearchResult, generate_operation_id()

## Recommendations for v7:

1. Standardize configuration approach (recommend multiple files for modularity)
2. Fix command-line interface inconsistencies
3. Complete all code implementations
4. Add missing glossary terms
5. Clarify Python version requirements
6. Fix polling interval math
7. Correct API usage examples
8. Define all referenced but missing components
