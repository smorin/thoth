Great, I’ll analyze the current configuration settings management and help system in the `smorin/thoth` repository. I'll evaluate the architectural patterns in place, identify any inconsistencies or weaknesses, and then propose a scalable and maintainable architecture that aligns with your priorities: default settings, consistent overrides, help integration, and a clear override hierarchy (internal defaults < config file < CLI < interactive mode).

I'll also compare with other open-source CLI tools to surface best practices that could inform a refined or new architecture for Thoth.

I'll let you know once I’ve gathered the findings and proposed the design structure.


# Designing a Clean, Configurable CLI Architecture for Thoth

## Current Configuration & CLI Design Overview

Thoth’s current implementation (as of v1.5) is a single-file CLI app using **Click** for argument parsing. It defines internal **default settings** (hard-coded in code) and optionally loads a TOML **config file** (`~/.thoth/config.toml` by default). For example, the `Config` class returns a default config dict (with values like `general.default_mode = "default"` and `general.default_project = ""`) if no file exists. If a config file is present, those values override the built-in defaults. At runtime, command-line **options** further override the config. In code, however, this layering isn’t applied uniformly – some config fields are not yet used when they should be. For instance, if you run `thoth "query"` with no `--mode`, the code still uses `"default"` hard-coded instead of your config’s `default_mode` setting. Likewise, if no project is specified, outputs are saved to the current directory (ad-hoc mode) rather than using a `default_project` defined in config. These examples highlight that while the *intended* precedence is **internal defaults < config file < CLI arguments**, the implementation has gaps where config values aren’t propagated. This can lead to inconsistency if a setting is defined in one place but ignored elsewhere.

Thoth also provides special CLI subcommands (`init`, `status`, `list`, `providers`, etc.) which are handled by manually intercepting arguments (instead of using Click subcommands). The help system is partially custom – e.g. a `ThothCommand` class overrides help behavior to show detailed help for subcommands like `init` or `status`, and there are custom functions to print help text for each command. There is currently no fully implemented **interactive mode** (aside from the planned interactive config wizard for `thoth init`), but the question hints at a future REPL-like mode where users can enter multiple commands interactively. In summary, the **current architecture** is functional but monolithic – configuration logic, CLI parsing, command handling, and help text are all intertwined in one file. This makes it easy to miss updating one part (e.g. help or config defaults) when changing another, and harder to test or extend (like adding new subcommands or an interactive shell).

## Goals for a Clean & Maintainable Architecture

To improve Thoth’s design, we want to achieve the following key objectives:

* **Single Source of Truth for Settings:** Define default values and configurable options in one place (or via one mechanism) so they don’t drift. Avoid scattering hard-coded defaults across the code.
* **Consistent Config Precedence:** Enforce a clear hierarchy where **internal defaults** are overridden by the **config file**, which is overridden by **CLI arguments**, and finally **interactive input** overrides all (since interactive mode can ask the user for final decisions). This priority order should be clearly implemented and documented (mirroring how other CLIs do it).
* **Unified Option Handling:** Ensure that any setting configurable in the file is also adjustable via CLI flag (and vice versa), and likely available in interactive mode as well. This prevents situations where a user can set something in `config.toml` but cannot override it on the command line, or an interactive user lacks access to an option.
* **Modularity and Separation of Concerns:** Break the program into logical components – e.g. *config management*, *command parsing/execution*, *interactive shell interface*, *help documentation*, *business logic* – to minimize side effects between them. This makes the code easier to understand and modify without affecting unrelated parts. For example, reading config should be isolated from the CLI parser (perhaps done once at startup), and help text definitions should be centralized rather than scattered.
* **Ease of Testing and Extension:** By designing clear interfaces between components, we can more easily unit-test (e.g. test that effective settings are computed correctly from various config/CLI combinations) and add new features. Adding a new subcommand or configuration option should require changes in only one or two places, not copy-pasting default values or help text in many spots.
* **Consistent Error Handling & Validation:** All parts of the app should use a common strategy for input validation and error reporting. For instance, invalid combinations of options are caught early with clear messages (Thoth already does some of this with `click.BadParameter` checks). A clean design would also validate config file contents (e.g. types, ranges) on load and provide uniform error messages via a central error handler (as `handle_error()` does for exceptions).

## Proposed Architecture Improvements

### 1. Robust Configuration Management Layer

Introduce a dedicated **configuration management layer** that consolidates all sources of settings and applies the override precedence. On startup, Thoth should:

* **Load Internal Defaults:** These could be defined as a constant dictionary or, better, as a dataclass/structured object for clarity. The current `_default_config()` method returns a dict of defaults – this is good, but we can make it a static config schema that’s easier to reference throughout the code (for example, a `DefaultConfig` dataclass with fields and default values).
* **Read Config File:** If the config file exists, parse it and merge its values onto the defaults. This can be done by a simple recursive update (only replacing keys that appear in the file) so that unspecified fields fall back to defaults. The `Config` class more or less does this now (loading TOML and using defaults if file missing). We should extend it to **fully merge** nested sections and potentially validate them. For instance, if a user’s config toml is missing a new field introduced in a later version, the defaults ensure a value is still present.
* **Apply Environment Variable Overrides:** Many CLI tools allow env vars to override configs for convenience. Thoth already substitutes `${VAR}` in the config with environment values for API keys. We can broaden this concept: define a naming convention for env vars (e.g. `THOTH_OPTION_NAME`) to override certain settings. For example, if `THOTH_OUTPUT_DIR` is set, use it instead of the config’s `paths.base_output_dir`. This is how tools like AWS and Azure CLI work – **CLI args > env vars > config file > defaults** is a common pattern. Even if we don’t expose many env vars, having the architecture support it (and clearly documenting which env keys map to which settings) adds flexibility.
* **Apply CLI Argument Overrides:** Finally, any options provided on the command line should override the above. A clean way to implement this is to perform the merges **before** running the main command logic. For example, after Click parses arguments, we create a `RuntimeConfig` object:

  * Start with the merged config (defaults+file+env).
  * For each CLI option that corresponds to a config value, if the CLI provided it (and it’s not None), update the config object. This could be done manually or automated. For instance, if `--project` is given, set `runtime_config.general.default_project` to that project name for this run; if `--mode` is given (or a positional mode), override the effective mode.
  * Some CLI flags might not directly map 1:1 with config fields (e.g. `--no-metadata` is essentially the inverse of a config boolean `include_metadata`). We would handle those accordingly in one place.
  * This merged **effective configuration** can then be passed into the core execution logic.

By computing an effective config upfront, the rest of the code can reference config values uniformly, without scattered `if flag is set do X else use config` logic. For example, in a refactored `run_research`, we would determine the final `mode` and `project` **once** from the config layer:

* `final_mode = CLI.mode_arg if provided else config.general.default_mode`
* `final_project = CLI.project if provided (even empty string to force ad-hoc) else config.general.default_project`

And similarly for output paths, timeouts, etc. This ensures that **config file defaults are honored unless a CLI override is present**, fixing the current omissions. (For instance, if `default_mode` in config is `"deep_research"`, then running `thoth "query"` would automatically use that mode by default in the new design, instead of always “default” mode as it does now.)

**Interactive mode** would sit at the top of this hierarchy. In an interactive session, the user might be prompted or able to input changes that override even CLI arguments. For example, interactive prompts could ask “Use which provider? (press Enter for config default)” – if the user enters a choice, that choice overrides what config/CLI specified. Conceptually, interactive inputs are just another form of CLI override, only provided at runtime. So the layering can be seen as: defaults < config file < env < initial CLI params < interactive confirmations. We should design the config management to be able to handle last-minute overrides easily (perhaps by simply updating the in-memory config object when an interactive user changes a setting). One way is to store the **current session config** in a mutable structure that the interactive shell manipulates. For instance, if in the REPL the user runs `:set default_mode = exploration`, it updates the session config, affecting subsequent operations.

**Validation** should be built into this layer as well. When merging and overriding, check that values are valid (type-check, range-check, etc.). If the config file or an environment variable provides something invalid, it’s better to catch it at load time and raise a clear error (possibly using the same `ThothError` mechanism for consistency). This prevents bad values from causing obscure failures deeper in the logic. A structured config (using a dataclass or schema library) can help here by enforcing types. For example, if `execution.poll_interval` must be a positive int, the config loader can verify that and report a cohesive error if not.

### 2. Unified CLI and Interactive Command Handling

To avoid duplicating command logic for different interfaces, we should structure Thoth’s commands in a modular way. The goal is that the **same underlying functions or classes** implement the core of each command (initialization, starting a research run, listing operations, etc.), whether invoked via the CLI or via an interactive shell.

A good approach is to separate the **parsing** of commands from their **execution**. We can achieve this by refactoring each command into its own function (this is already partially done, e.g. `init_command()`, `list_command()`, `status_command()` exist). We can take this further by organizing commands perhaps in a module or class structure. For example:

* Define a `commands/` package with modules or classes for each high-level command (`InitCommand`, `StatusCommand`, `ListCommand`, etc.) and one for the main “research query” execution flow.
* Each command object can have methods like `execute(config, **params)` and maybe a `help` description. The **help text** for each can live in a docstring or attribute here, making it easy to reuse for CLI `--help` and an interactive `help` command.
* The Click CLI would wire these up either as subcommands or via a dispatcher. Currently, Thoth uses a single Click command and manually inspects `args[0]` for subcommands. We could simplify by using Click’s **Group** and subcommand structure – e.g. `thoth init`, `thoth status`, `thoth list`, and a default command for running research queries. This would let Click handle a lot of help text formatting for subcommands automatically. However, it’s possible to keep the current single-command approach and still map into our command functions.

For instance, if using subcommands, the `thoth` group could have a subcommand `run` (or even make the group itself accept a query for the default case). Another technique is to accept the first argument as either a mode or special command. Either way, once we determine which command to run, we call the corresponding command handler function/class.

In an **interactive mode** (likely a simple REPL loop reading user input), we can reuse these same handlers. The interactive shell can parse a line of input by splitting it into command words and arguments. A small parser can map the input to our command functions:

* If the user types a known command name (`init`, `status <id>`, `list`, `providers`, etc.), call that handler.
* If the input doesn’t match a command, treat it as a research query (possibly with an optional mode prefix, similar to CLI syntax). For example, entering `exploration How does X work?` could be interpreted as mode="exploration", query="How does X work?" – using the same logic as the CLI uses for positional mode detection.
* Provide some interactive-only commands like `help` (list available commands or detailed help), and `exit` to quit.

By using the same command handlers, we ensure consistency: whether the user runs `thoth list --all` in the shell or types `list --all` in interactive mode, it goes through the same `list_command(show_all)` function. This fulfills the **“don’t repeat yourself”** principle – we won’t need to implement the logic twice or worry that one interface diverges from the other.

We may choose to restrict certain options in interactive mode for simplicity. The user mentioned not wanting “all the help options available in interactive mode.” In practice, an interactive UI can assume some global context that the CLI must always specify. For example, in an interactive session we might maintain the current project or default mode as part of session state, so the user doesn’t need to type `-p projectX` every time – they could set it once. Thus, the interactive `help` might not list global flags like `--project` because the interactive user could set that via a separate command (e.g. `use projectX`) or an initial prompt. The design should **allow selective exposure of options** in interactive mode. We can achieve this by designing the help system (next section) to be aware of context, or by coding the interactive command parser to not require certain flags that the CLI parser would. For instance, if the interactive session has a “current project” context, the `run research` command in interactive mode would automatically apply that, ignoring the `project` flag.

Another benefit of a clean separation is easier **future extensions**. If Thoth later gains a GUI or web interface (out of scope now, but noted as future possibilities), those could also call the same command logic under the hood. A well-structured core that only depends on a config object and inputs, not on Click’s `Context` or `sys.argv`, is portable across interfaces.

### 3. Unified Help and Documentation System

Maintaining help text in parallel with code can be tedious and error-prone. We want the help output (for both CLI `--help` and interactive `help` commands) to stay in sync with actual functionality. Here are design suggestions to achieve this:

* **Leverage Click for CLI Help:** If we refactor to use Click subcommands, we can rely on Click to display each command’s help message, options, and defaults automatically. We can still customize formatting (as is done with the `ThothCommand` subclass to control epilog and subcommand help), but we won’t need a bunch of separate `show_X_help()` functions as in the current implementation. Each command function’s docstring can serve as the description in `click.command(help=...)`, and options will be listed by Click. This reduces duplication. For example, `thoth init --help` would show the description and usage without us manually printing lines as done in `show_init_help()`.
* **Dynamic Insertion of Defaults and Sources:** The help text should indicate default values and possibly where they come from. We can configure Click options to show default values (Click supports an `show_default=True` flag for options). For instance, `--poll-interval` could show “(default: 30)” which might be the internal default or a user’s config override. We can take inspiration from Azure CLI, which documents that if you set a default in config, you don’t need to pass that argument every time. We might not dynamically reflect user-specific config in the help (since help is usually static), but we can document the existence of config and how it overrides defaults.
* **Interactive Help:** In the interactive shell, a simple approach is to implement a `help` command that lists available commands and a brief description (similar to how many REPLs or DB shells do). This would exclude global CLI flags that aren’t relevant in interactive mode. Instead, it can mention commands like `help <command>` for details. For detailed help on a specific command in interactive mode, we could reuse the same text as CLI help but formatted without the `thoth` prefix. For example, interactive `help status` could print the usage and description of the status command (which we could obtain from the command object’s metadata or by calling Click’s help programmatically for that subcommand). Another idea is to maintain the help strings in one place (say, as class-level docs for each command handler) and have both interfaces pull from there. This ensures if we update how a command works, we update one help description that is shown in both contexts.
* **Config Option Documentation:** To avoid “invisible” config settings (that a user might set in the file but not realize they could also set via CLI), we should document all configurable keys. One approach is to include a **“Configuration”** section in the CLI help or README that lists each config key, its default, and the corresponding CLI flag (if any). For example, we can document that `default_mode` (config file key) corresponds to the first positional argument or `-m/--mode` flag on the CLI, `poll_interval` corresponds to `--poll-interval` (hypothetically, if we add such a flag), etc. This could be done in help output (some tools like AWS CLI explicitly list environment and config equivalents in the help for each option). At minimum, the user manual or `README` should have a table of config settings and how to override them via CLI. This ensures **feature parity** and helps developers remember to add both config and CLI support for new settings.
* **Examples and Consistency:** The help system should provide usage examples that reflect the precedence and typical use. For instance, showing an example of using a CLI flag to override a config value can clarify how overrides work. In the current epilog, Thoth already lists examples like using a specific mode or getting command-specific help. We should continue this practice and update examples to cover new features (like how to use interactive mode, or how config defaults simplify commands).

By designing the help content alongside the config and command definitions, we ensure any new setting or command automatically gets documented. Adopting a convention (like always adding a `--<name>` option for any new config entry) will make it easier to catch missing pieces. Additionally, we could consider a simple **unit test** or check: iterate through default config keys and verify each has either a CLI option or is documented as “config only.” This kind of reflection is easier if config is a structured object.

### 4. Example Precedence Logic Implementation

To concretize the design, let’s outline how the **precedence logic** could be implemented in practice, incorporating inspiration from other CLI tools:

* On startup, load defaults and config file into a `config` object (`Config` class instance). For example, after parsing CLI, the code might do: `config = Config(path=cli.config_path_override)`. This object now has `config.data` representing defaults overlaid with file contents (and environment substitutions applied).
* Next, explicitly override with CLI arguments. For instance:

  * If user provided `--output-dir`, set `config.data["paths"]["base_output_dir"] = <that path>` for this session.
  * If `--no-metadata` flag is true, set `config.data["output"]["include_metadata"] = False`.
  * If `--provider` is given, override the chosen provider for the operation (this one might not directly live in config, but we could handle it as a special-case variable).
  * If `--mode` or mode positional argument is given, that determines the research mode; otherwise use `config.data["general"]["default_mode"]`. (This is where we fix the earlier oversight: e.g., if config default\_mode is "deep\_research", it gets picked up when no CLI mode is specified.)
  * If `--project` not given, use `config.data["general"]["default_project"]` (if that is non-empty) as the project name. If that’s empty, it implies ad-hoc mode (current directory). In other words, allow a user to set a default project in config to avoid specifying `-p` each time.
  * Apply any interactive overrides (if this is an interactive session, this step might happen per command if the user changes settings on the fly).
* At this point, we have a final unified view of settings for the operation. We can pass this unified `config` (or just relevant values) into the core functions. For example, we might call `run_research(config, mode, query, provider, ...)` and inside it rely on `config.data` for things like timeouts, poll intervals, etc., without needing to consider CLI vs file origin. The **business logic** can trust that the config values already respect the override hierarchy.

This approach aligns with best practices from other CLI systems. For instance, AWS CLI documentation clearly states that command-line options override environment vars, which override config file settings. Azure CLI does similarly and even provides an `az init` interactive command to set defaults in the config file. In our design, Thoth’s `thoth init` could evolve into such an interactive setup (it already plans to, per the TODO) where the user is guided to set default values, which are then saved to the config file. This emphasizes having *one* canonical store of defaults (the config file) that the user can edit, rather than baking them in code or requiring repetitive flags.

## Additional Considerations & Inspiration from Other Tools

**State Management in Interactive Mode:** If we implement a REPL, we’ll need to manage state (current config, possibly last query, etc.). A simple approach is to keep a global or context object for the session. Each interactive command will use and possibly modify this state. For example, an interactive user might do: `config project MyProject` (to set the current project), then just type queries which will now automatically use that project. This mirrors how tools like database shells maintain a current database or how `git` has a current repo context. Designing the interactive commands to manipulate the in-memory config will allow “interactive overrides” that don’t persist (unless the user explicitly writes them to the config file via something like `save config`). We should clarify which changes are ephemeral vs saved – e.g., switching the default mode in a live session won’t edit the TOML file unless commanded.

**Extensibility and New Features:** With a cleaner architecture, adding a new research “mode” or a new provider integration would typically involve adding defaults to the config (perhaps under `modes` or `providers`), and maybe a new CLI flag if needed. Our design should make this straightforward. Notably, Thoth already merges user-defined modes from the config with built-in modes – a good design choice that we should preserve. For providers, if a new provider is added, ideally one just adds a section in the config (with API keys or settings) and perhaps a `--api-key-<name>` option. The code that creates provider instances can loop through configured providers generically. This kind of **data-driven extension** is easier when config and logic are decoupled from the CLI specifics.

**Inspiration from Other CLIs:** Many open-source CLI tools have tackled similar design challenges:

* **Git**: Git uses a layered config (system, global, local) and allows overriding any config key with the `-c key=value` CLI option. It achieves flexibility by reading config once and then letting command logic use those values. While Git doesn’t have an interactive mode, the concept of *scoped config and override* is similar to what we want.
* **Kubernetes kubectl**: Uses a kubeconfig file for defaults (cluster, user, namespace) and CLI flags to override (`--kubeconfig`, `--namespace`, etc.). The precedence is CLI over config, and they provide an interactive mode via external tools (like `kubectl alpha interactive`). Kubectl’s design is modular, with a clear separation between the CLI command definitions and the underlying API calls – an analogy for separating our Click interface from the research execution logic.
* **AWS CLI & Azure CLI**: As noted, they have well-defined config systems. The AWS CLI example explicitly lists the order of precedence (CLI > env > credentials file > config file), and Azure CLI similarly enumerates CLI > env > file. In our case, **Interactive** would be an even higher layer (since it’s essentially asking the user to confirm or change options at runtime). We can document Thoth’s precedence in its help or docs in a similar way: for instance, “**Note:** Command-line arguments override settings in `config.toml`, which in turn override Thoth’s internal defaults. In interactive mode, prompts and commands can override all of the above for that session.”
* **Azure’s defaults command**: Azure CLI’s `az config set defaults.<name>=<value>` is an interesting model where users can set persistent defaults for any argument. We might not implement a full equivalent, but conceptually, `~/.thoth/config.toml` serves this role. We could also consider a command like `thoth config set <key> <value>` to programmatically update the config file (for advanced users or scripting), but that can be future work.

**No Impact on Out-of-Scope Concerns:** It’s worth noting that these changes focus on **software design, not runtime performance or security** (explicitly out of scope). The architecture can remain efficient (the overhead of merging configs is negligible) and we are not introducing security issues (we’re actually making API key handling more consistent by clearly delineating how to supply them via env, config, or CLI – e.g. continuing to encourage env for secrets is fine). We also continue to use well-supported libraries (Click, etc.) so the maintainability remains high.

Finally, by implementing this clean architecture, **maintainers and contributors** will find it easier to reason about the system. If a bug arises where a setting isn’t applied, one can inspect the config loading logic and override steps to find it, rather than chasing through scattered conditionals. Likewise, adding a new “timeout” option would involve adding a default in one place and perhaps a CLI flag, with the framework automatically handling merging and help text, thereby reducing the chance of error.

In summary, the redesigned architecture will provide a **clear separation** between configuration management (with layered overrides) and command logic, ensure that **defaults and overrides are consistently applied**, and unify the user experience across CLI and a potential interactive shell. By studying patterns from tools like AWS CLI and Azure CLI (which emphasize configuration flexibility and clear precedence rules) and by refactoring Thoth’s code into modular components, we address the missing aspects (like unified help, single truth for settings, and easy override logic) that are needed for a truly scalable and maintainable CLI design.

### How Git actually handles multiple config files

*Git never stops at the first file it finds.*
When you run **any** Git command, it **merges** the content of all configuration files it can see, reading them **in a fixed order** and letting later files override earlier ones for keys that collide:

| Order read | Typical path                                                | Scope                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
|  1         | `/etc/gitconfig` (or `<prefix>/etc/gitconfig`)              | *system‑wide*           |
|  2         | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config` or `$HOME/.config/git/config` | *user‑specific, XDG*    |
|  3         | `$HOME/.gitconfig`                                          | *user‑specific, legacy* |
|  4         | `$GIT_DIR/config` ( `.git/config` inside the repo)          | *repository/local*      |

After these, any `-c key=value` command‑line snippets or environment variables (e.g. `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`) override the file settings, and finally the command‑specific flags you typed override everything.
Git’s documentation states:

> “The files are read in the order given above, **with the last value found taking precedence over values read earlier**. When a variable can take multiple values, all values from all files are used.” ([Stack Overflow][1])

So:

* **Scalar keys** – e.g. `user.name` – are overwritten by the later file.
  *System → XDG → global → local → `-c`/env → CLI flag*
* **Multi‑valued keys** – e.g. `remote.origin.fetch` – are *accumulated*; Git keeps every value it meets.
* A file can also include other files via `include.path` or `includeIf`, adding yet another layer that is merged in the same “last one wins” fashion.

---

### Adapting this idea to **Thoth**

If you want Thoth to mimic Git’s convenience while keeping the simple precedence we sketched earlier, just insert two extra **file layers**:

```
internal defaults
        ↓
user‑level config      (~/.config/thoth/config.toml)
        ↓
project/local config   (./thoth.toml or ./.thoth/config.toml)
        ↓
environment variables  (THOTH_…)
        ↓
initial CLI options    (--foo …)
        ↓
interactive overrides  (entered or confirmed at run‑time)
```

#### How to merge

1. **Load defaults** into an in‑memory dict or dataclass.
2. **Read the user file** if it exists and deep‑merge it onto the defaults

   * Keys present in the user file replace the default value (scalar) or append (list/set).
3. **Read the project file** (search upward from CWD, like Git) and merge it the same way, overriding any colliding keys from the user file.
4. **Apply environment overrides**: for every recognised `THOTH_*` variable, convert it to the matching config path and set/append.
5. **Apply CLI flags/positional args**: for each option that was explicitly provided, overwrite the value in the working config.
6. **Interactive session** (REPL) can still call `config set <key> <value>` or similar; just mutate the same in‑memory object—those are the last changes seen before a command executes.

Because every layer is merged, you **never lose** settings that were defined in broader scopes—you only *override* the few keys you need to change.

#### Implementation sketch

```python
from pathlib import Path
import os, tomllib
from thoth.schema import Config  # a @dataclass describing every field

def load_layer(path: Path) -> dict:
    if path.is_file():
        return tomllib.loads(path.read_text())
    return {}

def deep_merge(base: dict, override: dict) -> dict:
    for k, v in override.items():
        if isinstance(v, dict) and k in base and isinstance(base[k], dict):
            deep_merge(base[k], v)
        elif isinstance(v, list) and k in base:
            base[k].extend(v)
        else:
            base[k] = v
    return base

def build_runtime_config(args) -> Config:
    cfg = Config()                            # internal defaults
    deep_merge(cfg, load_layer(Path.home() /
                               ".config/thoth/config.toml"))             # user
    deep_merge(cfg, load_layer(find_project_config()))                   # local
    deep_merge(cfg, env_to_config(os.environ))                           # env
    deep_merge(cfg, cli_to_config(args))                                 # CLI
    return cfg
```

*Search strategy*: `find_project_config()` walks from the current directory upward until it finds `thoth.toml` (or `.thoth/config.toml`).
*Conversion helpers*: `env_to_config()` and `cli_to_config()` translate env‑var names / Click options to the nested‑dict structure described by `Config`.

### Why merging beats “pick‑one” files

* **Developer ergonomics** – you can set company‑wide defaults once, personal tweaks in your home dir, and repo‑specific overrides (API keys, output paths) without retyping everything every time.
* **Forward compatibility** – new config keys added in later releases fall back to defaults even if old per‑repo files don’t mention them.
* **Predictability** – the algorithm is identical for every run; debugging a value is just a matter of printing each layer in order.

If you need to *disable* an inherited value, borrow Git’s pattern: support a sentinel like `null` (TOML) or an explicit `unset = true` switch so a higher‑priority file can blank out a key.

---

### Key take‑aways

1. **Git merges** all visible config files—later ones override earlier ones for single‑value keys; lists accumulate. ([Stack Overflow][1])
2. Thoth can replicate this by adding **user** and **project** config layers between defaults and env/CLI, then performing a deep merge at start‑up.
3. With a single in‑memory “effective config” object you guarantee that every command—CLI or interactive—obeys the same, easily testable precedence chain.
