## 2. Executive Summary

Thoth is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that automates deep technical research using multiple LLM providers. **The primary use case is simple: just give it a prompt and get comprehensive research results in your current directory.** While Thoth supports advanced features like mode selection, project organization, and async operations, the default experience is optimized for immediate, zero-configuration research.

### Core Value Propositions
- **Instant research**: Just `thoth "your prompt"` – no mode selection needed
- **Multi-provider intelligence**: Automatic parallel execution of OpenAI and Perplexity
- **Zero-configuration deployment**: Works immediately with API keys
- **Current directory output**: Results appear right where you are working
- **Advanced features when needed**: Full mode control, projects, and async operations available
- **Production-ready reliability**: Checkpoint/resume, graceful error handling, and operation persistence

## 4. Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Default mode | When no mode is specified, uses a special 'default' mode that passes prompts directly to the LLM without any system prompt. Files created with this mode include 'default' in the filename pattern. NOTE: Quick mode (`thoth "prompt"`) uses "default" mode, NOT "deep_research" |
| Quick mode | Simplified invocation with just a prompt, using all defaults |
| Mode | Workflow phase (clarification, exploration, deep_research, thinking) with its own prompt template |
| Provider | LLM backend (openai, perplexity, mock) |
| Mock provider | Test provider that returns static responses WITHOUT requiring API keys (accepts any value as dummy key for testing) |
| Operation ID | Unique identifier for each research operation (format: research-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx) |
| Background mode | Asynchronous execution where job is submitted and CLI exits immediately |
| Ad-hoc mode | Default mode where files are saved to current working directory |
| Project mode | Mode where files are saved to `base_output_dir/project-name/` |
| Combined report | Synthesized report merging results from multiple providers (requires --combined flag) |
| Output file | File created in format: YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_deep_research_<provider>_<slug>.md |
| Mode chaining | Automatic flow from one mode to another using --auto flag |
| Adaptive polling | Dynamic adjustment of status check intervals based on operation characteristics |
| Provider fallback | Automatic failover to alternate provider on failure |
| Model cache | Local storage of provider model lists to reduce API calls and improve performance. Stored in ~/.thoth/model_cache/ |
| Cache refresh | Process of updating cached model lists, either automatically (after 1 week) or manually via --refresh-cache flag |

thoth "impact of quantum computing on cryptography"
# This sends your exact prompt to the LLM without modification
# Creates in current directory:
#   ./2024-08-03_143022_default_openai_impact-of-quantum-computing.md
#   ./2024-08-03_143022_default_perplexity_impact-of-quantum-computing.md  

# With combined report (requires flag)
thoth "impact of quantum computing on cryptography" --combined
# Also creates:
#   ./2024-08-03_143022_default_combined_impact-of-quantum-computing.md

# More quick examples
thoth "best practices for API design"
thoth "comparison of React vs Vue frameworks"
thoth "how does TCP congestion control work"

# Quick mode with single provider
thoth "kubernetes networking explained" --provider openai
thoth "kubernetes networking explained" -P openai  # Short form

# Testing with mock provider (no API key needed)
thoth "test prompt" --provider mock
thoth "test prompt" -P mock  # Short form
```

### 12.2 Per-Project Configuration (v2.1)

Projects can have their own configuration that overrides the global config:

```toml
# .thoth/config.toml in project directory
[project]
name = "quantum_research"
base_output_dir = "./research"

[providers.openai]
model = "gpt-4-turbo"           # Override for this project

[output]
combine_reports = true          # Always combine for this project
```

### 12.3 Minimal Configuration

For users who want the absolute minimum, Thoth works with just environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="pplx-..."
# That's it - thoth is ready to use
```

## 14. Error Messages

### User-Friendly Error Handling

All errors go to stderr for proper shell scripting:

```bash
# Missing API keys
$ thoth "quantum computing"
Error: OpenAI API key not found
Please set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable or run 'thoth init'

# Network issues with retry
$ thoth "distributed systems"
Network error: Unable to reach OpenAI API
Retrying in 2s... (attempt 2/3)
Retrying in 4s... (attempt 3/3)
Error: Failed to connect after 3 attempts

# Long operation
$ thoth "analyze all cloud provider services"
This research may take 15-30 minutes. Consider using --async:
  thoth "analyze all cloud provider services" --async
  
Continue anyway? [Y/n]:

# Invalid provider
$ thoth "test" --provider invalid
Error: Unknown provider: invalid
Valid providers are: openai, perplexity, mock

# Rate limit handling
$ thoth "complex analysis"
Rate limit reached for OpenAI
Waiting 60s before retry...
Falling back to Perplexity provider
```

## 19. Testing Requirements

### Test Suite Status
As of v2.5, the test suite includes:
- **M8T Test Suite**: 10 tests for OpenAI provider achieving **100% pass rate**
  - M8T-01: OpenAI provider initialization with API key
  - M8T-02: OpenAI provider handles missing API key
  - M8T-03: OpenAI provider handles invalid API key
  - M8T-04: OpenAI timeout configuration from CLI
  - M8T-05: OpenAI provider async operation returns job ID
  - M8T-06: OpenAI provider creates output file
  - M8T-07: OpenAI provider with verbose shows configuration
  - M8T-08: OpenAI provider handles rate limit gracefully
  - M8T-09: OpenAI provider with custom config file
  - M8T-10: OpenAI provider handles network timeout
- **Core Test Suite**: 28/28 tests passing when using the mock provider
- **Enhanced Test Infrastructure**: Separate Makefile targets for independent verification

### Mock Provider Behavior
The mock provider is essential for testing and has been fully implemented to:
- Work without any API keys (F-32 requirement satisfied)
- Accept any value as a dummy API key for testing purposes
- Return predictable responses
- Support all provider interface methods
- Simulate realistic delays
- Generate valid output files
- Bypass API key validation when `--provider mock` is specified
- Support mode chaining with --auto

### Error Output Standards
**Important Note**: Rich console library outputs to stdout by design, which is correct behavior for terminal UI libraries. Error messages are properly routed to stderr while UI elements use stdout.

Standards implemented:
- Exit codes follow POSIX conventions (F-35 satisfied)
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Mode and provider validation happens before API key checks (F-34 satisfied)
- Commands return proper exit codes: 0=success, 1=general error, 2=usage error

### Validation Order
The tool validates in this order (fully implemented):
1. Command structure (missing prompt = exit 2) ✓
2. Mode validity (invalid mode = exit 1) ✓
3. Provider validity (invalid provider = exit 1) ✓
4. API key presence (missing key = exit 1) ✓
5. API key validity (invalid key = exit 1) ✓

This ensures users get the most relevant error message first.

### Implementation Details

Key features implemented in v2.5 (OpenAI Provider):
- **AsyncOpenAI Client Integration**: Full async support with httpx timeout configuration
- **Response Storage**: Dictionary-based storage pattern for concurrent operations
- **Timeout Configuration**: Three-level precedence (CLI > config > default)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive handling for authentication, rate limits, network errors
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff using tenacity decorator
- **Configuration Support**: model, timeout, temperature, max_tokens from config file
- **CLI Override**: --timeout flag with highest precedence for request timeouts
- **API Key Masking**: All API keys properly masked in output

Key features implemented in v2.1:
- Output directories are created automatically if they don't exist (F-36)
- Init command works with custom config directories via XDG_CONFIG_HOME (F-37)
- Mock provider properly overrides mode-specific provider preferences
- Empty queries are properly validated with appropriate exit codes
- All test patterns updated to match actual output formats
- Combined reports require explicit --combined flag
- Progress display shows elapsed time, next check, and timeout (with implementation status noted)
- Provider flag supports -P short form
- Quiet mode uses -Q flag
- Mode chaining with --auto flag
- Providers command with dynamic model discovery for OpenAI (F-101, F-102)
- Hardcoded model list for Perplexity provider (F-103)
- Provider filtering with --provider flag (F-105)
- Rich table formatting for model display with dynamic column width (F-106)
  - Model ID column width automatically adjusts based on longest model name
  - Ensures model IDs like `gpt-4o-mini-audio-preview-2024-12-17` are never truncated
  - Minimum width of 20 characters for consistent formatting
- Graceful error handling for invalid providers (F-107)
- Note: Due to Click option parsing, providers command requires -- separator: `thoth providers -- --models`
- New commands: update, clean, config, export, import
- Provider fallback and health monitoring
- Adaptive polling intervals
- Shell completion support

### Test Infrastructure Requirements

The test suite requires infrastructure for comprehensive testing:

#### Checkpoint Test Fixtures (M22-01 to M22-05)
- Create test fixtures for checkpoints with different statuses
- Generate aged checkpoints for time-based testing
- Utilities for verifying checkpoint deletion
- Mock checkpoint files with various corruption states
- Test cleanup to prevent test pollution

#### Test Patterns
- Use predictable patterns for test-generated files
- Implement cleanup after each test run
- Support parallel test execution without conflicts

### Manual Testing Requirements

Some features require manual testing due to their interactive or environment-dependent nature:

#### First-Time User Experience (AUDIT-012)
- Manually test the automatic setup wizard for missing API keys
- Verify prompts appear correctly and config is saved
- Test with various combinations of existing/missing environment variables
- Validate that the wizard only appears when needed

#### Network Retry Logic (AUDIT-013)
- Test automatic retry on transient network errors
- Verify retry attempts are properly displayed
- Test timeout behavior on persistent network failures
- Validate error messages for different network conditions

These manual tests should be documented in a separate testing guide and performed before each release.

## End of Thoth v2.1 PRD

This specification prioritizes the simplest possible user experience while maintaining all advanced capabilities. The primary innovation is making `thoth "prompt"` the default interaction pattern, removing friction for users who just want quick, comprehensive research results in their current directory.

Key principles:
- **Simple by default**: Just prompt and go
- **Progressive disclosure**: Advanced features available when needed  
- **Current directory convenience**: Results appear where you work
- **Clear communication**: Simple progress and obvious output locations
- **Testability first**: Mock provider enables comprehensive testing

The tool serves both casual users who want instant research and power users who need fine-grained control over the research process.
